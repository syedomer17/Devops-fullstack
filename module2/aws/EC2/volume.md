## What is an EBS Volume?

An EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your EC2 instances. EBS volumes persist independently from the life of an instance.

---

## Create a New EBS Volume

1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. In the left navigation pane, click **Elastic Block Store > Volumes**.
3. Click **Create Volume**.
4. Choose **Volume Type**, **Size**, and **Availability Zone** (must match the AZ of your EC2 instance for attachment).
5. (Optional) Enable encryption and configure other parameters.
6. Click **Create Volume**.

---

## Attach an EBS Volume to an EC2 Instance

1. In the **Volumes** section, select the volume to attach.
2. Click **Actions** > **Attach volume**.
3. Select the desired **Instance** (must be in the same Availability Zone).
4. Specify the device name (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`).
5. Click **Attach**.

---

## Detach an EBS Volume

1. In the **Volumes** section, select the volume to detach.
2. Click **Actions** > **Detach volume**.
3. Confirm the detachment. Wait until the state is **available** before reattaching or deleting.

---

## Delete an EBS Volume

> **Warning**: Deleting an EBS volume is irreversible and will permanently remove all data stored on the volume. Make sure to back up any important data (e.g., by creating a snapshot) before deleting.

1. Make sure the volume is **available** (not attached to any instance).
2. In the **Volumes** section, select the volume you want to delete.
3. Click **Actions** > **Delete volume**.
4. Confirm by clicking **Delete**.

---

## Resize (Expand) an EBS Volume

### Step 1: Modify the EBS Volume

1. Select your volume in **Volumes**.
2. Click **Actions** > **Modify Volume**.
3. Enter the new, larger size.
4. Click **Modify**, then **Yes** to confirm.

### Step 2: Resize the File System (Linux example)

After increasing the EBS volume size, you must resize the file system on the instance.

- For ext4/xfs (most common root volumes):

```bash
# Check device name (e.g., /dev/xvda1 or /dev/nvme0n1p1)
lsblk

# For ext4:
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

# For xfs:
sudo xfs_growfs -d /
```

---

### Resize a Root EBS Volume

You can resize a root volume the same way as any other volume. After modifying the volume, SSH into your instance and follow the steps above to resize the file system.

---

## Attach One EBS Volume to Multiple EC2 Instances

- **Standard EBS Volumes**: Can only be attached to one instance at a time.
- **EBS Multi-Attach (io2 Block Express and some io1)**: Allows attaching a single volume to multiple instances in the same AZ. Use for clustered applications (e.g., clustered databases).
  - When creating the volume, select **io1** or **io2 Block Express** and enable **Multi-Attach**.
  - Attach to multiple instances as shown above.

## Types of EBS Volumes

| Volume Type        | Use Case                                  | Key Features                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **gp3** (General Purpose SSD) | Most workloads, boot volumes           | Low cost, good performance                   |
| **gp2** (General Purpose SSD) | Legacy general purpose                 | Scales with size, replaced by gp3            |
| **io1/io2** (Provisioned IOPS SSD) | High-performance databases, critical apps | High IOPS, can use Multi-Attach, higher cost |
| **st1** (Throughput Optimized HDD) | Big data, data warehouses              | Low cost, not for boot volumes               |
| **sc1** (Cold HDD)             | Infrequent access, archives            | Lowest cost, not for boot volumes            |

## Encrypting EBS Volumes

- Choose **Enable Encryption** when creating the volume (cannot be disabled after creation).
- For existing unencrypted volumes, create a snapshot, copy it with encryption enabled, and create a new volume from the encrypted snapshot.
- **All data, disk I/O, and snapshots are encrypted.**

---

### What Happens When You Encrypt an EBS Volume?

- Data at rest, disk I/O, and backups (snapshots) are encrypted using AWS KMS keys.
- Performance impact is negligible for most workloads.
- Only instances with the required IAM/role permissions can attach encrypted volumes.

## Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: How do you resize an EBS volume and its file system?
**A:**  
Modify the volume size in the AWS Console, then resize the file system on the attached EC2 instance using `resize2fs` (for ext4) or `xfs_growfs` (for xfs).

---

### Q2: Can you attach an EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances?
**A:**  
Standard volumes can only attach to one instance at a time. io1/io2 volumes with Multi-Attach enabled can be attached to multiple instances in the same AZ.

---

### Q3: What are the different types of EBS volumes, and when should you use them?
**A:**  
- gp3/gp2: General workloads and boot volumes.
- io1/io2: High-performance, latency-sensitive workloads.
- st1: Throughput-intensive, large datasets.
- sc1: Cold data, archival.

---

### Q4: How do you encrypt an EBS volume, and what happens when you do?
**A:**  
Enable encryption during creation or via encrypted snapshot copy. All data, I/O, and snapshots are encrypted, and only authorized users can access.

---

### Q5: Can you shrink an EBS volume?
**A:**  
No, you can only increase the size. To shrink, create a new, smaller volume and migrate the data.

---

### Q6: How do you attach an EBS volume to an instance in a different Availability Zone?
**A:**  
You cannot directly attach across AZs. Create a snapshot of the volume, then restore it as a new volume in the desired AZ.

---

### Q7: What is the difference between EBS and instance store volumes?
**A:**  
EBS volumes are persistent and survive instance termination; instance store volumes are ephemeral and data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.

---

### Q8: How do you delete an EBS volume?
**A:**  
First, detach the volume from any instance. Once the volume is in the 'available' state, select it in the AWS Console and choose "Delete volume". Confirm the deletion.
